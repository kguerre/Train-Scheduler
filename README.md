# Train-Scheduler
Homework 7

### Overview

In this activity, I created a train schedule application using Firebase to store and update arrival and departure data. The site displays up-to-date train information based on calculations using Moment.js. On this site, users will see the name of the various trains, their destinations, and arrival times. Users can also add new data to the current train schedule.
